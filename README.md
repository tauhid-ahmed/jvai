‚úÖ Task Completion Note
Dear Shakil bhai & JVAI Team,

Thank you for the opportunity.

I‚Äôve completed the assigned React.js task based on the given instructions and live website reference. Here's a quick summary of my work:

üõ†Ô∏è What I Did:
Recreated the site structure using vanilla React and React Router DOM.

Used Redux for state management (avoided Context API or UI libraries for simplicity and clarity).

Followed the component hierarchy and routing flow as observed in the reference site.

Implemented API integration with the provided backend (ALI.postman_collection.json).

Styled the app using Tailwind CSS, as per the requirements.

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Limitations:
Some UI/UX polish and visual accuracy were skipped due to the limited time frame.

Encountered server-side issues while creating a new chat:

Server rejected all content types: application/json, multipart/form-data, and plain text.

This happened both in my code and when testing directly through the provided Postman collection.

Despite these blockers, I attempted multiple workarounds and ensured the rest of the functionality was covered properly.

üîç Tech Stack Used:
React.js (with React Router DOM)

Redux (no react-hook-form or third-party UI library)

Tailwind CSS (customized with utility-first approach)

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like a walkthrough or if further refinement is required.

Thanks again for the opportunity.
