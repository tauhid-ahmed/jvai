      "Chartwright has been transformative for our clinic. Our therapists were drowning in documentation; We've slashed average charting time to under 3 minutes per patient, freeing up hours for direct care. More importantly, we've seen a significant reduction in documentation errors and compliance flags. It's not just faster; it's smarter documentation.",

It takes my detailed notes and instantly creates the clear, customized charts I need. I'm getting hours back each week â€“ hours I can now spend directly with patients, tackling barriers, not just typing.",
